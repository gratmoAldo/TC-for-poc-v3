Hello Charlie,

I think I found the solution: since you mentioned that you have a NetApp device connected to your network, all you need to do is disconnect that device and reboot your EMC device and you should be golden.

Should you have any question or concern, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Kind regards,
-Sameer

Event log analysis
The times reported for the issue are 7:30-8:00am and 7:30-8:00pm local time.
There are no issues reported over the last 2 weeks in the system event log
We see at or around the reported time the following events

Hello Erik,

After all was said and done the customer went with P17 on the Content server.  I tested the cfs program again, and upon preliminary testing found no problems.  I trust that it is safe to close this case.

 

Thanks for your help and patience.

 

Pete

Hello Peter,

 

I wanted to follow up with you, as I havent seen any email threads on this issue for a bit.  My last internal update was that you were going to move forward with the P16 hotfix provided previously with a supportability document.  Is this still the current status of this issue?

 

Please update me at your earliest convenience.

Hello Erik,

Regarding the P16+hotfix that EMC released to us last week. 

As you know all components of the customer's system are on P14, and the bug report was also listed against 6.5SP3 P14.  

Knowing this, we supposed that a hot-fix would be released against the customer's version P14.  However, in this case, the fix was released against P16.  

Since it is good practice to keep versions consistent for all Documentum components, we would like to know if the hot-fix can be re-released against P14 and not P16?  

Otherwise, we would have to patch all components to P16/P17 which is time consuming and costly, especially if these things occur in a validated environment. 

 

Please let us know the timing for a hot-fix to P14 to resolve this issue.

Pete

Importance: High

Hi,

I have tested the Performance of the backup working and I have attached the Screen Shot of the same.

The same backup works faster in the old machine Dell Power Edge 2950 MB1000 that completes in 5 min.

Customer gave us time on the Tuesday to check the same performance and grab the logs.

He informed that he has a yearend process and it will scan all the records that are 1 million+ records and informed that for each record it will perform 1 write and 5 read.

The previous storage array used to take 30+ hours do the same activity and as per his calculation it would take more than 2+ days.

I have taken the IO meter Test and noticed that the following(Max Throughput and 100% Seq and 100% Read average):
SPA LUN:
IOPS:3400+
MB/s: 107+
Average IO Response time: 7 to 8 Ms

SPB LUN:
IOPS:3100+
MB/s: 101+
Average IO Response time: 8 to 9 Ms

VM_prod LUN on SPB:
IOPS:2900+
MB/s: 90+
Average IO Response time: 8 to 9 Ms

I will get the logs on Tuesday.

Was customer having issues with Shares file system that had the 92 snaps?  The Shares file system was originally on SPB and stats show SPA was far busier than SPB.   Can you help us understand the reason for moving Shares file system?
